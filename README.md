# ProjectOne
First Project for Software Developer Bootcamp

## Description
Our project is a calendar application designed to help users track and manage tasks throughout the month, with an emphasis on prioritizing tasks based on urgency. The goal of this project was to create an intuitive and efficient tool for organizing tasks and deadlines for the upcoming weeks.

This application addresses the challenge of determining when tasks should be completed by allowing users to set urgency levels for each task. By prioritizing tasks according to urgency, it ensures that users stay on top of their responsibilities and deadlines.


## To use this calendar
1. Click on the date or day you wish to add a task to.
2. Select “Add Task” and enter the task description.
3. Choose the urgency level for the task and press Enter to save it.
5. To mark a task as completed, click on it, and a line will be drawn through it.
6. To remove a completed task, click the “X” button next to it.
7. The "View" dropdown menu allows you to toggle between Month, Week, and Day views.
8. Use the Next/Previous arrows to navigate between months, weeks, or days.
9. Clicking the "Today" button will take you directly to the current date in the active view.
