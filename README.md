# ProjectOne
First Project for Software Developer Bootcamp

## Description
Our project is a calendar that helps keep track and check off tasks throughout the month with leveling urgency. Another thing this project does is help be a good study guide.
Our motivation for this was to create a simple and easy way to organize the tasks that you have the upcoming weeks and to help motivate the importance of studying.
This project helps solve the problem of when a task should be completed meaning setting how urgent a task is to get done will put it, it also solves the annoyance of having to study with a feature to add flash cards which will earn you points.

## Usage
To use this calendar
1. Click on the date/day that you want to add a task to
2. Click add task and type out the task you would like to 
3. Decide how urgent that task is then click enter
4. To check off a task simply click it and itâ€™ll be taken off the task list

Flash cards coming soon
